# history-GAN
experiments in adding history to GAN

Experiments by adding the outputs of the previous outputs of the generators to the future iterations and see the effect. 
The base code has been taken from Wassterstrin introspective neural networks and WGP-GAN.

The experiments show that the addition of the images from the previous iterations of GAN worsens the performance of GAN.
